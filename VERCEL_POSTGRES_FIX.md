# Vercel PostgreSQL + Neon Database Fix

## Problem
When deploying to Vercel with Neon database (PostgreSQL), you may encounter connection issues due to missing parameters in the connection string. Neon has specific requirements for serverless environments that need to be handled programmatically.

## Solution
The issue has been fixed by modifying the Prisma client configuration in `src/lib/prisma.ts` to automatically handle Neon database requirements for serverless environments.

### What was changed:
1. **Modified `src/lib/prisma.ts`**: Added a `getConnectionString()` function that automatically adds Neon-specific parameters to the connection string.

2. **Updated Prisma Client initialization**: The Prisma client now uses the modified connection string through the `datasources` configuration.

### Neon-specific parameters added:
- `sslmode=require` - Required for secure connections
- `connect_timeout=10` - Handles Neon's cold start delays
- `channel_binding=require` - Required for Neon compatibility
- `pgbouncer=true` - Enables connection pooling for serverless

### Testing:
- The solution has been tested with various connection string formats
- Build process completes successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Deployment
1. Commit and push your changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Vercel - the connection string will automatically include the required parameter
3. Your CRUD operations should now work correctly on Vercel

## Environment Variables
Make sure your Vercel environment variables are set:
- `POSTGRES_URL`: Your Neon database connection string (basic format)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Your admin password

### Neon Connection String Format
Your Neon connection string should look like:
```
postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

**Important**: Make sure to use the **pooled connection** endpoint from Neon (it should include `-pooler` in the hostname for better serverless performance):
```
postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

All required parameters (`sslmode`, `connect_timeout`, `channel_binding`, `pgbouncer`) will be automatically added by the application.
