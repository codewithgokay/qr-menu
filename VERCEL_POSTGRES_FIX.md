# Vercel PostgreSQL Channel Binding Fix

## Problem
When deploying to Vercel with PostgreSQL, you may encounter connection issues due to missing `channel_binding=require` parameter in the connection string. This parameter cannot be added directly in Vercel's environment variable settings.

## Solution
The issue has been fixed by modifying the Prisma client configuration in `src/lib/prisma.ts` to automatically append the `channel_binding=require` parameter to the connection string.

### What was changed:
1. **Modified `src/lib/prisma.ts`**: Added a `getConnectionString()` function that automatically appends `channel_binding=require` to the PostgreSQL connection string if it's not already present.

2. **Updated Prisma Client initialization**: The Prisma client now uses the modified connection string through the `datasources` configuration.

### How it works:
- The function checks if `channel_binding=` is already present in the connection string
- If not present, it adds `channel_binding=require` as a query parameter
- It handles both URLs with existing query parameters (using `&`) and without (using `?`)

### Testing:
- The solution has been tested with various connection string formats
- Build process completes successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Deployment
1. Commit and push your changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Vercel - the connection string will automatically include the required parameter
3. Your CRUD operations should now work correctly on Vercel

## Environment Variables
Make sure your Vercel environment variables are set:
- `POSTGRES_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (without channel_binding parameter)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Your admin password

The `channel_binding=require` parameter will be automatically added by the application.
